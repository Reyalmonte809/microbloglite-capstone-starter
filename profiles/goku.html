                <div class="bio">Goku Biography</div>
                <div class="whitetext"> Goku is a central character in the popular Japanese manga and anime series
                    "Dragon Ball," created by Akira Toriyama. He is depicted as a Saiyan, a powerful warrior race known
                    for their incredible strength and ability to transform into more powerful forms. Goku's journey
                    begins when he is discovered as a baby by an old martial arts master named Gohan, who raises him
                    with a kind heart despite Goku's Saiyan origins.<br>

                    As Goku grows up, he exhibits an insatiable appetite for fighting and improving his skills. His
                    defining trait is his pure-heartedness and unwavering determination to protect his loved ones and
                    the Earth from powerful villains. Throughout the series, Goku continuously trains to become
                    stronger, often surpassing his limits through intense battles and encounters with formidable foes.
                    He forms deep bonds with other characters who join him in his quest, such as his lifelong friend
                    Krillin and the wise mentor Master Roshi.<br>

                    Goku's ultimate goal is to become the strongest fighter in the universe and to defend his home
                    planet from any threat. His journey unfolds across various story arcs, where he faces increasingly
                    powerful adversaries and discovers new levels of strength within himself. Over time, Goku evolves
                    from a carefree and naive martial artist into a legendary hero whose exploits inspire generations of
                    fans worldwide.<br></div>
