                <div class="whitetext"> Ainz Ooal Gown, also known as Momonga, is the central character in the dark fantasy light novel and anime series "Overlord," written by Kugane Maruyama. Initially a player of an immersive virtual reality game called Yggdrasil, Ainz finds himself trapped within the game after it shuts down. As the guild leader of Ainz Ooal Gown, he becomes the powerful undead Overlord within the game's world.<br>

                    Ainz begins his journey in this new reality with a sense of confusion and isolation, but soon embraces his new identity and surroundings. His goal shifts from finding a way back home to exploring the vast world of Yggdrasil and asserting his dominance over it. With an array of powerful magic and an army of loyal followers, Ainz establishes his presence as an enigmatic and feared figure in the land of Nazarick, which becomes his stronghold.<br>
                    
                    Throughout the series, Ainz grapples with the moral implications of his actions and the responsibilities of leadership. Despite his undead appearance and immense power, he retains a sense of humanity and occasionally shows glimpses of compassion, particularly towards his loyal guardians and the inhabitants of Nazarick. Ainz's journey is marked by strategic decision-making, political maneuvering, and the exploration of the limits of power in a world where he now reigns supreme.<br></div>
